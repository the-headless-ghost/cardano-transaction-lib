**cardano-transaction-lib** (CTL) is a Purescript library for building smart contract transactions on Cardano. It aims to port the functionality and interface of Plutus off-chain code to the browser environment.

## Roadmap

- [x] **Stage 1** Build a simple transaction in the browser that works with at least one light wallet (Nami)
- [x] **Stage 2** Once we can construct a simple user-to-user transaction, we will try to use the library to submit the tx with nami
- [x] **Stage 3** Once we have a simple working transaction, we will seek to build a Plutus smart contract transaction with datum from scratch
- [x] **Stage 4** Once we can construct Plutus smart contract transactions, we will seek to build a library/DSL/interface such that transactions can be built using constraints and lookups - as close as possible to a cut-and-paste solution from Plutus' `Contract` monad code in Haskell (but with no guarantee that code changes are not necessary)
  - [ ] **Stage 4.1** Investigate supporting compatibility with the Vasil hardfork and improvements to our initial `Contract` API (**In progress**)
- [ ] **Stage 5** Once we have a basic `Contract`-style API, we will further refine its public interface, expand wallet support (see [below](#light-wallet-support)), expose a test interface (see [here](doc/plutip-testing.md)), provide a more ergonomic JS/TS API, support stake validators, and support CIP workflows on the public testnet
- [ ] **Stage 6** Once CTL's `Contract` interface has been stabilized, we will add support for even more wallets and attempt to deprecate CTL's currently required Haskell server

### Light wallet support

Support is planned for the following light wallets:

- [x] [Nami](https://namiwallet.io/)
- [x] [Gero](https://gerowallet.io/)
- [x] [Flint](https://flint-wallet.com/)
- [ ] [Lace](https://www.lace.io/)
- [ ] [Typhon](https://typhonwallet.io/)
- [ ] [Yoroi](https://yoroi-wallet.com/)
- [ ] [Eternl (formerly CCvault)](https://eternl.io/)

Due to recent ecosystem migration from legacy testnet to `preprod` and `preview` networks, some of the wallets stopped working. The progress of adapting them is tracked in [this issue](https://github.com/Plutonomicon/cardano-transaction-lib/issues/994).

## Architecture

CTL is directly inspired by the Plutus Application Backend (PAB). Unlike PAB, however, CTL is a library and not a standalone process. Over the course of CTL's development, several questions have been raised as to how best create PAB-as-a-library:

1. How do we get the transaction in the right format?
   - This is handled by `cardano-serialization-lib`, a Rust library available as WASM
2. How do we query the chain?
   - This has been solved using Ogmios
   - We may, however, support a BlockFrost backend as well in the future
3. How do we query for datums (i.e. the datums themselves and not just their hashes)?
   - `ogmios-datum-cache` solves this problem
4. How do we submit the transaction?
   - This is done via browser-based light wallet integration in the browser based on CIP-30
5. How closely should we follow Plutus' `Contract` API?
   - CTL's `Contract` model is **significantly** less restrictive than Plutus' and allows for arbitrary effects within the `Contract` monad
   - Certain features cannot be directly translated into Purescript from Haskell due to differences between the two languages (e.g. CTL's `DatumType` and `RedeemerType` are type class with fundeps, as Purescript lacks any notion of type families/type-level functions)
6. A lingering concern remains around storage solutions, if needed
   - This can be in memory, in various browser storage solutions, or a decentralized DB like Fluree
